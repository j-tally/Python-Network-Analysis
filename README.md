### Social Network Analysis and Visualization for Outsides' Facebook Page 

Using [netvizz](https://apps.facebook.com/netvizz/), the [Outsides](https://www.facebook.com/outsidesmusic/) Facebook page was downloaded in Graph Description Format (GDF) and converted to the Pajek file format for some basic social network analysis. After converting the format to JSON, a D3.js [force-directed graph](https://bl.ocks.org/j-tally/9dae2fcf8e5f23d2b9001f5314ed2301) was created to visualize the page network.
